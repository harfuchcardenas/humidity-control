This repository is for measuring the humidity and temperature using DHT11 sensor connected to a nrf7002-DK board from Nordic semiconductors. It has been devloped on Zephyr OS which is an RTOS to create a subroutine to measure these factors on equally time spaced intervals. The used GPIO is to be determined as well as the output control of the fan.

After getting the fan controled the next step will be to control it based on the humidity in order to control it.
